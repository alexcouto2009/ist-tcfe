\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In the present laboratory we produced an audio amplifier circuit and improved it.
Looking at both analysis and as it has already been said in subsection \ref{sub:comp}, we can say that the results obtained were very accurate since the differences that
were already expected weren't very high, being these related with the more complex models used by ngspice and by some approximations made in the theoretical analysis.
As for the merit we achieved the purpose of the laboratory of maximizing its value and we are satisfied with research made in order to complete this objetive.
Last but not least, this laboratory assigment conducted to gain more knowledge and lead to a better understanding of both functions of an usual speaker and matters related
to the course.
Despite being aware that nowadays digital circuits are much more prefered we are still happy in reproducing a working audio amplifier which could easily be used in a speaker.
