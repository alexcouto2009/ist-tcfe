% state the learning objective 
The objective of this laboratory assignment is to build an ac/dc converter using one ideal transformer and some diodes, resistors and capacitors.
The challenge of this laboratory is to make the best ac/dc converter and for that we must be smart and make a balance quality vs cost, because the result will be the
quocient between those quantities.

In this presentation, we will start to show an image of our ac/dc converter and explain why we choose that squeme. After that, we will present the ngspice simulations 
for this circuit and compare with octave theoretical analysis. Then we will go over some other configurations that were important to take some conclusions that were 
important to reach the final setup. To conclude, we will present some final conclusions.
