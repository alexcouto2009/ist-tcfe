\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}


In the present laboratory we produced a bandpass filter and improved it.
Looking at both analysis and as it has already been said in subsection \ref{sub:comp}, we can say that the results obtained were very accurate since the differences that
were already expected weren't very high, being these related with the more complex models used by ngspice.% and by some approximations made in the theoretical analysis.
As for the merit we achieved the purpose of the laboratory of trying to maximize its value and we are satisfied with research made in order to complete this objetive.
Last but not least, this laboratory assigment conducted to gain more knowledge and lead to a better understanding of OP-AMP and matters related to the course.
%Despite being aware that now a days digital circuits are much more prefered we are still happy in reproducing a working audio amplifier which could easily be used in a speaker.

%Despite being aware that now a days digital circuits are much more prefered we are still happy in reproducing a working audio amplifier which could easily be used in a speaker.






%In the present laboratory we produced an AC/DC converter and analysed it successfully. In both theoretical and simulation analysis 
%we achieved similar results eventhough there were non-linear components in it which we were expecting to bring bigger differences. As for merit obtained, after all the testing 
%and research made we are happy with the result achieved at the end. 

%To approach a future work in this area we could study more components that can do the same job and who knows even be more efficient (like zener diodes or transistors).

%So this laboratory contributed to our global knowledge and we think that it was important to absorb some concepts and skills for the course and who knows for a future job.
