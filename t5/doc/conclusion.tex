\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}


In the present laboratory we produced a bandpass filter and improved it successfully.
Looking at both analysis and, as it has already been said in subsection \ref{sub:comp}, we can remark that the results obtained were very accurate since the differences that
were already expected weren't very high, being these related with the more complex models used by ngspice.% and by some approximations made in the theoretical analysis.
As for the merit we achieved the purpose of the laboratory of trying to maximize its value and we are satisfied with research made in order to complete this objetive.
Last but not least, this laboratory assigment conducted to gain more knowledge and lead to a better understanding of OP-AMP and matters related to the course.
%Despite being aware that now a days digital circuits are much more prefered we are still happy in reproducing a working audio amplifier which could easily be used in a speaker.
For future laboratories we would like to suggest taking in account the volume of the components in the merit formula and give us a little more freedom with the ammount of components we can use, since with the inclusion of their volume in the formula we would also have to balance the ammount of components used.
