\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

As a pack, the results predicted by the Theoretical Analysis of the circuit match the ones obtained when simulating the circuit in NGSpice. This was already expected since the circuit is only built with linear components. However, we can see small differences in tables values mainly due to rounding and also some differences may occur in the graphs because of different solving methods of the circuit mainly in Topic 5, since NGSpice solves differencial equations and we solved the problem using a numerical method.
Summing everything up, we can say that the laboratory objective of analysing the circuit has been achieved due to the match of results.

%In this laboratory assignment the objective of analysing the mentioned circuit has been
%achieved. Voltages and Current static analyses have been performed both
%theoretically using the Octave tools and by circuit simulation using the
%Ngspice tools. The simulation results matched the theoretical results
%precisely and both theoretical analyses produce consistent results. The reason for this perfect match is the fact that this is a
%straightforward circuit containing only linear components, so the theoretical
%and simulation models cannot differ.
