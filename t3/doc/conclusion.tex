\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In the present laboratory we produced an AC/DC converter and analysed it successfully. In both theoretical and simulation analysis 
we achieved similar results eventhough there were non-linear components in it which we were expecting to bring bigger differences. As for merit obtained, after all the testing 
and research made we are happy with the result achieved at the end. 

To approach a future work in this area we could study more components that can do the same job and who knows even be more efficient (like zener diodes or transistors).

So this laboratory contributed to our global knowledge and we think that it was important to absorb some concepts and skills for the course and who knows for a future job.
